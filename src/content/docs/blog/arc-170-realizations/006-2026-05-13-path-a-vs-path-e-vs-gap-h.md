User direction confirmed both contracts matter:
- **Path A** (deftest): prelude at OUTER top-level under do; parent shares prelude content
- **Path E** (deftest-hermetic): prelude INSIDE the closure; strict isolation; parent untouched

User: *"users must make a choice where their programs run."* The substrate enforces the contract via shape; both shapes ship.

Gap G attempted Path E shape; substrate rejected `define`-at-expression-position. Sonnet refined Path A→two flavors:
- **A-narrow**: runtime local-env-frame registration (splits `define` semantics by position; rejected)
- **A-wide**: closure-extraction lifts prelude defines into prologue (preserves "define = top-level registration" as single mental model; selected)

User decided: *"A-wide is the path - let's get it documented and in motion."*

The conceptual win in A-wide: `define` keeps its single meaning (top-level registration). The LIFT moves the form to where top-level processing happens. The substrate's `DefineInExpressionPosition` rejection STAYS — never gets reached because the lift removes the form from expression position before eval sees it.
