title: "R2 — a complete Rete fell out in a day, because it was assembly, not invention"

The north star went green and the builder said it plain:

> *"we built a complete rete in under a day — that's…. insane."*

It is worth being precise about *what*, so "insane" reads as method and not luck. What shipped, end to end,
in a day: alpha matching; **equality joins with real cross-condition unification** (the HashJoinNode — the
part every toy evaluator hand-waves); production firing; **cascade to a monotone fixpoint**; **truth maintenance
with transitive retraction** (retract a supporting fact, its whole derived chain vanishes); and a homoiconic
`defrule` / `query` surface — in a language that did not exist as a general substrate a year ago. Not a naive
stand-in. The thing Forgy's 1974 thesis is about, with the parts CLIPS / Drools / Clara add bolted on,
green against an acceptance test (`cold-and-windy`) that was written on day one and never moved.

**Why it was possible — the grounded version:**

- **It was assembly, not invention.** The hard parts were already on the shelf: persistent collections
  (0a–0d), the total-pure macro-eval engine (arc 249), types-as-forms (arc 251), records, the WatAST bridge,
  symbol-table reflection. Rete was *orchestration of Rust with clean syntax* — exactly what wat is for
  ([[project_wat_is_spec_rust_is_impl]]). The day was wiring capability that already existed; every prior arc
  was a stone in this foundation without knowing it.
- **The north star was the contract from minute one.** One green test fixed the target; every stone aimed at
  it. No drift, no scope-debate mid-build.
- **The strike discipline did the compounding.** Each stone: draw (DESIGN + a RED probe that fails on
  *exactly* the gap) → fire one sonnet → weigh against an independent re-run + the diff → ship green. Slow is
  smooth; we never fought the same boss twice.
- **The inserts-only thesis paid triple** ([[project_rete_inserts_only_replay]]): it kept the engine simple
  (pure value-semantics, no mutation), it made TM *fall out of replay* instead of needing a justification
  graph, and it handed us a known-correct **oracle for free** (R1).
- **Grounding caught the rabbit holes before they cost a day each:** the `defrule` macro loop, the `query`
  Bundle-archaeology smell (→ the `return-type-of` intrinsic), the 4b input/derived TM bug, the
  keyword-resolves-to-its-constructor "is-it-a-defect" question (it isn't — names resolve to bindings). Each a
  fifteen-minute probe, not a five-hour wrong turn.

**The honest asterisk:** this is the *correct-but-slow* Rete (`~130–820 facts/s`, O(N²) — the
re-run-from-scratch oracle). The day did not produce the fast engine. It produced the **spec the fast engine
will be held to** — which is the more valuable artifact, and the reason the speed is *repeatable* rather than a
one-off.

**This is the bar, and it is the close.** The builder set both the target and the scope:

> *"we exceed clara/java — at minimum not having a gc means we are theoretically faster already?"*
> *"i don't think this is a new arc — i think this is the closing condition for the rete arc as a whole."*

So arc 278 does not close at the green north star. It closes when the **Rust fire kernel** — delta propagation,
`join-bindings`-keyed joins, native mutable memories behind the transient/freeze boundary — is **differential-
tested bit-for-bit against this oracle** and **benched at or past Clara**. And the GC point is real, not a
boast: Clara runs on the JVM, where a stop-the-world pause is a tail-latency spike at exactly the wrong moment
for line-rate packet processing. Rust has no GC — ownership + `Arc` refcounting, no pauses, cache-dense native
structures. At the line, *predictable* latency (no GC jitter) may matter as much as raw throughput, and we get
it by construction. Theoretically ahead before we optimize a thing; the arc closes when we prove it on the
bench.
